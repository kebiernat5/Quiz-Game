## My Logic Process 

In starting this project, I initially wanted to set up my logic in a way that  was understandable to me. This is what I worked through. 

### LOGIC - JS
click the start button
    timer starts 
    I am presented with a question
answer a question
    presented with another question
if question incorrect
    time subtracted
if no more questions or the timer reaches 0
    game over
        ask for user initials
        save initial and score

## My Structure Process

After figuring out how I wanted the logic to work, I then worked through how I wanted the page to look when the user arrived at the page. I decided I wanted a chalk board theme to jazz things up a bit, so I created a CSS file to apply the different styles I wanted to in order to achieve the look on the page.
